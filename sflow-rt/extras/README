This directory contains example Python scripts demonstrating sFlow-RT's
REST API:

* tail_log.py       - tail the event log
* tail_flows.py     - tail flow log
* leafandspine.py   - create hybrid OpenFlow fabrics using Mininet
* topflows.py       - text based client displaying top flows

Note: The Python scripts make use of the Python requests library:
      http://python-requests.org/

The init.d directory contains a startup script that can be used to run sFlow-RT
as a daemon.
